Research & Projects — Post-It Layout Page
Overview

This page presents an overview of my research, writing, and project-based work using a post-it–style visual layout. Each post-it represents a distinct project, collaboration, or research thread, offering direct access to related outputs such as interactive visualisations, publications, reports, or external platforms.
The layout is designed to encourage exploratory navigation and to reflect the iterative and multi-sited nature of my work across research, civic technology, writing, and creative practice.

Post-It Structure & Content

Each post-it card consists of:

A front face displaying the project or research title
A back face revealing links to relevant materials, publications, or external sites

The post-its currently represent the following projects and research areas:

Brazilian Citizen Labs

Links to an interactive mapping project exploring Brazilian citizen labs and participatory initiatives.
The visualisation is currently under construction and represents ongoing research.

Book Participation

Materials related to my participation in a published book project, including:
A Substack post contextualising the contribution
A link to the book PDF
This work engages with indigenous voices and their representation in global agendas.

Electoral Observation Project

Documentation and media coverage related to an electoral observation initiative, including:
The 2018 final report
Coverage by Forbes
Coverage by The Nation
This project reflects work at the intersection of civic engagement, electoral integrity, and democratic processes.

Selected Rough Dialogues

A curated selection of written reflections published on Substack, addressing themes such as:
AI and identity
Technoculture and participation
Civic technology and drones
These pieces represent exploratory and critical writing rather than finalized academic outputs.

MYOOZ InC

A link to the MYOOZ InC label website, representing creative and organisational work beyond strictly academic research.
Navigation & External Links

All post-its link directly to external pages or documents. Content opens in new tabs to support parallel exploration without interrupting navigation within the page.

Purpose

This page functions as:

A portfolio-style overview of my research and project landscape
A navigational map connecting academic, civic, and creative work
A living index that can evolve as new projects are added
It prioritises breadth, connection, and accessibility over exhaustive documentation.

Design Rationale

The post-it metaphor is used to:
Reflect research as an ongoing, iterative process
Allow non-linear exploration of diverse work
Visually distinguish between different types of projects and outputs
Colour differentiation is used to support visual grouping without imposing rigid categorisation.


Usage

Open the page in a modern web browser. Click or interact with individual post-it cards to access project materials. No additional setup is required.
